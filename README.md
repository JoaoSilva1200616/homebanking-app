# 5. Conclusion

Overall this was a very productive challenge. I was more confortable in Node.JS because it was simillar in structure of what we already did in ISEP but for me the hardest part was the frontend part because I did it in React and I have never worked with React before so it was a fun experience learning it and now I think I have some understanding of the language.
